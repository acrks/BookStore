# BookStore
A final group project that was created with students needs in mind.

All students have had the displeasure of having to search for individual materials on a website. 

This bookstore is different. Which just a few clicks, a student can choose to purchase all the materials needed for a class. A student does not even have to load in their own classes, that information is attached to the user's account.

The bookstore also takes into account the condition of the book, and if the student would like to sell their own copy of the book back to the bookstore.

A store credit system is also utilized.

Upon logging out from the user's account, a receipt will be printed in the form a txt file.

All references to real books are to fully simulate the buying experience a student would go through.
